<h1>Wolfery's Terms of Service</h1>

<p>These Terms of Service (or just "Terms") let you know the rules that govern
our relationship with you as a user of our game and forum, which is collectively
referred to as the "Service". These Terms form a contract between you and
Mucklet AB ("we", "us", "our"), to let you know what we give you rights to use
this Service for, and also what rights you agree to give to us.</p>

<p>We reserves the right to update these Terms for reasons including, but not
limited to, complying with changes to the law or reflecting enhancements to the
Service. If the changes affect your usage of the Service or your legal rights,
we will notify you at least seven days before the changes take effect.</p>

<p>By using our Service, you agree to these Terms. Of course, if you don't agree
with them, don't use the Service.</p>

<h2>Who can use the Service</h2>
<p>No one under 18 is allowed to create an account or use the Service. This is
because we cannot guarantee that the content is suitable for minors, since much
of the content is produced by other users. We would also not be able to properly
safeguard minors against grooming, or other illicit behavior.</p>

<h2>Rights we grant you</h2>
<p>We own this Service, but we give you the right to use it and enjoy it, in a
way that these Terms and the in-game rules allow. We may revoke this right at
any time for reasons including, but not limited to, you using the Service in a
way not authorized by these Terms (including helping others to do so), or if you
do not comply with the in-game rules.</p>

<h2>Rights you grant us</h2>
<p>Our Service allows you to create, send, receive, upload, and store
information; also called "content". When you do that, you retain whatever
ownership right in that content you had to begin with. But you grant us the
right to use that content for the purpose it was provided, even if you decide to
stop using the Service or delete your account.</p>
<p>You also give us the right to access, review, and delete any content that we
think violates these Terms or the in-game rules. You alone, though, remain
responsible for the content you provide.</p>

<h2>Privacy</h2>
<p>Our <a href="privacy.html" class="privacy link">Privacy Policy</a> describes
how we store and handle the information you provide to us.</p>

<h2>The content of others</h2>
<p>Just like you keep whatever ownership you had for the content you provide,
others will also do so for their content. Whether that content is made public or
sent to you in private, you may only use that content for your own private
purpose, unless you get the rights from the owners.</p>
<p>Also, just like you are responsible for the content you provide, others are
responsible for the content they provide. Although we reserve the right to
review content, we do not necessarily review it all. So we cannot - and do not -
guarantee that other users' content will comply with these Terms and the in-game
rules.</p>

<h2>Respecting others' rights</h2>
<p>You may not provide content that infringes on someone elses intellectual
property. If you use an image, or add content based on someone elses work,
make sure you have the rights to do so. And give credits where credit is
due.</p>

<h2>Permitted use</h2>
<p>You must only use the Service in a way permitted by these Terms. This means,
among other things, you may not do, attempt to do, enable, or encourage anyone
else to do, any of the following:</p>
<ul>
<li>use the Service in a way not permitted by law;</li>
<li>use the Service in a way that could interfere, disrupt, negatively affect, or inhibit other users from fully enjoying the Service;</li>
<li>access or use the Service in any manner that could damage, disable, overburden, or impair the function of the Service;</li>
<li>attempt to gain unauthorized access to the Service including, but not limited to, other accounts, other users' content, or server infrastructure;</li>
<li>create or use bots accessing the Service for any other purpose than improving game play;</li>
<li>create a new account if we have disabled your account;</li>
</ul>

<h2>Disclaimers</h2>
<p>We provide this service to you "as is" and "as available", without warranty
of any kind. We want to keep it a fun and safe place to hang out, but we cannot
promise that it will always be available or that it will be fit for any
particular purpose.</p>

<h2>Limitation of Liability</h2>
<p>To the extent permitted by law, we don't take responsibility for any negative
consequences, direct or indirect, related to using our Service, or inability to
access the Service. Such negative consequences includes, but is not limited to,
loss of data, loss of profit, loss of goodwill, or other intangible losses. And
you agree to not hold us, or anyone associated with making this Service
available, liable for any such negative consequences.</p>

<p>Mucklet AB or its proprietors may not be held accountable for content
provided by the users of the Service. We will take reasonable actions to
moderate this content in accordance with these Terms.</p>

<h2>Governing Law</h2>
<p>This Agreement shall be governed by and construed in accordance with the laws
of Sweden. The Swedish court of general jurisdiction, and, in first instance
the Örebro District Court (Sw. Örebro tingsrätt), have exclusive jurisdiction to
settle any dispute arising out of or in connection with this Agreement.</p>
